This is my first attempt at an open source software contribution.  I'll update this as I progress through the steps, but It's probably not going to be pro grade.

No worries!  Iterate through and keep learning, right?

Here goes!


The project is for creating a docker container that renders a host shell in the browser.  The container will conect via SSH to the host so that communication is relatively secure.  

It has the potential of causing some havoc, so I'll try and build some safety into the application so that you don't hose yourself too easily by accident (God knows I've done it enough times myself!).
